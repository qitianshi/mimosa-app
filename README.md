## Intro
Formulas are hard. Mimosa is a formulas app, and it'll change that. With detailed explanations, easy search, and intuitive learning, Mimosa works for students, teachers, and professionals alike. Browse through comprehensive libraries of formulas from a multitude of categories, customize them by adding notes, or even add new formulas of your own. Mimosa demonstrates how terms interact and substitute, lets you visualize how their values change, and shows you formulas in real life.

Formulas needn't be hard.
